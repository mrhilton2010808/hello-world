hello world!
My name is michael.  I am really interested in all types of development.  I started out wanting to be a web devloper, but that turned into the desire to learn it all.  I want to know web devlopment, software development, mobile devlopment, and even white hat hacking. I look forward to the day when I can start making major contributions to some of the open source projects on github.
